### A Complaint Letter to SF Express 

Dear SF Express Customer Service,

I am writing to express my unsatisfaction of the service provided for shipment number SF1459914836459. The shipment, which included a custom-made shirt, experienced significant delay, and arrived with the package in poor condition. 

(1) The timeline of events and the state of delivered shirt are totally unsatisfactory, not meeting the standards displayed in the SF Express App.

(2) The shirt was found to be marked with multiple Arabic number “4”, which was not present before shipment. This suggests that my package must have been opened and repacked during the shipment, which is a serious violation of shipment service contract.

Given the shirt was custom made and the nature of damage, I am requesting compensation. Considering the shirt was insured against damage or lost for 500 RMB, I request compensation four times of this number, totaling of 2000 RMB.

This shipment service left me with bad experience and I trust that SF Express will handle this case seriously enough and provide a solution that matches the inconvenience and damage caused. Attached you will find an evidence file supporting my claims.

Thank you for your attention and time, I look forward to your prompt response and solution. 

Sincerely,

Gao Yang
