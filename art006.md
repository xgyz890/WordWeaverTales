### No More Loneliness After You Watch Theirs: A Review of True Detective (Season 1)

In my humble opinion, True Detective is definitely a five star. I highly recommend this show. Well, I rarely say this, but I promise you, this show gets better after a couple of episodes.

A LOT better.

But first you have to make it through its start. It’s indeed slow.
Louisiana, 1995, two detectives sit in an old sedan, on their way to a crime scene. Maybe along the way, they tell funny stories and make jokes, you think, like other police-criminal comedies.

But no. No conversations, no witty comments. Marty (played by Woody Harrelson) tries to lighten things up, but Rust (played by Matthew McConaughey) gets lost in his own thoughts and says nothing back. No chemistry at all. 

At the scene was a young woman, found dead. Her name was Dora. Dora wore antlers and knelt down to a tree as if she was praying. Her body was filled with meth and LSDs. 
On their way back, The car is on a deserted suburban road. From a bird view, you see messy grass, gigantic advertisement boards that have rust in the corners, ruined churches, and dilapidated factories. 

This is what you get. This scene, I remember, tastes like dry rust. Funny thing, Rust later reveals he has synesthesia, a symptom where your senses crosstalk and translate into each other.

This already slow pace gets even slower, even the scene where Rust watched a carousel of autopsy photos all night did not help. After you survive through the first two episodes, you realize that this show is not a high energy fast-paced crime-centered one like Criminal Minds; it turns rather into a story of philosophy and way of living.

This show focuses on humanity. I have to say this is an ambitious theme. To carry its weight, a slow start is essential and the payoff you get afterwards is worth it. 

You witness humanity lived out by these two detectives. In the past, they worked together, caught criminals, and freed a bunch of children from imprisonment. In my opinion the thing that led them was a mixture of their sense of righteousness and law enforcement’s capacity. Years pass by and Rust “bumps into” Marty and immediately asks him for help on a case. 

Now there are two narrative lines. The Rust line is on the surface. That children imprisonment case was officially over, but he did not stop as a suspect in another case told him about the Yellow King, which was closely connected to the Dora case. Soon afterwards, that suspect “killed” himself in prison. This confirmed Rust’s suspicion over the case. He had been biting on it ever since. In his speculation of a new murder case (which he figured was connected with the Dora one) in 2010, he kept lingering around the crime scene that the police listed him as a suspect. He broke into a house of a suspect and fetched some photos and a tape. That tape recorded a serious and nasty crime, which convinces Marty (and Rust himself) that Rust is not paranoid. No longer a detective, an inner calling pushed Rust forward to follow the case. Along the way, he becomes a true detective. 

The Marty line, on the other hand, is hidden below. He is persuaded to help Rust when Rust shows him a whole garage of evidence of murder against children and women. In fact, Marty was not persuaded by Rust, but by himself. Deeply in his heart, Marty knows these facts, and he knows that these scums are still out there killing. These beliefs are a seed in Marty’s mind. This mentality is implied in the show by a close up shot of a broken left rear lamp on Rust’s car. That mirror was broken in the fight between Marty and Rust. After the fight, they never meet again, until now. This broken mirror symbolizes Marty’s regret over Rust and the unresolved case.

Now they are reunited, pursuing the criminals as a team. Marty finds a piece of key evidence that points directly to a man called Errol, aka “the green ears”. Later on, they are able to track Errol down in his cave, then he takes Marty down and stabs Rust in the belly. A moment before Errol kills Marty, Rust pulls himself up and shoots Errol in the head. The policemen dig up bags of victim bones from Errol’s front yard, confirming he is the criminal behind all the missing children’s cases.

Undoubtably, the depth and complexity make True Detective a masterpiece. It stirs up a million-dollar question: **what defines a man?** 

My answer is the idea that leads you and compels you into actions. To Rust, that idea is to root up crime and crush it. It seems like a clear path, but Rust struggles along the way, because his destiny as a detective has cost him a lot of other things in life. He is stopped by obstacles, and yet he keeps pushing through them. Crime after crime happens, and Rust fights against one after another. 

Rust quotes Nietzsche, time is a flat circle, to show his anger, because every time he solves a crime, he finds a new, bigger one hidden below. Rust says that crime happens like an endless loop. But what he doesn’t say is, in this endless loop, he and Marty make choices again and again, and each and every time, they choose to be detectives. 

If you peel open this show, you will see a Sisyphean tragedy at its core. True Detective reveals the origin of loneliness and shows how these two men carry their burden. It offers several scenes of Rust alone, meditating. If you allow yourself to be immersed in this show, you will see these scenes are a perfect reflection of loneliness. When we see Rust and Marty sacrifice things for their destiny, we know their loneliness is inevitable; and this loneliness has no escape, because they willingly devote themselves to it. 

In the end, on their way fleeing from the hospital, Rust talks about the fight between light and dark, like the stars persisting and shining in the night sky. Marty said that it seems that the dark is intimidating and taking up all the space. Rust replied, if you look at the shining stars, the light is still winning. This is a beautiful catharsis of their loneliness, and ours.
