### The Boat Ride in West Lake

Imagine this: two young tourists rushing through crowds along the banks of West Lake, breathless, their heavy bags bouncing as they sprint to catch a boat.

Yep, that was me and Amber last weekend in Hangzhou.

Around 9:30am on Sunday, we reached West Lake. We found a cozy coffee shop overlooking the water and decided to grab some coffee on its second floor. We had heard about a scenic boat ride called Wuguitan (Turtle Pond), but getting a reservation was proving tricky due to its popularity.

However, while sipping coffee and gazing at the lake, Amber spotted a boat driver on social media. He offered to reserve two spots for us, but there was a catchâ€”we had to reach his dock and find him within 20 minutes.

Within five minutes, we were already in a taxi, the map showing us just 15 minutes away from the dock. What could possibly go wrong?

But as our taxi approached the final turn, we were stopped by two officers at the corner. The road was blocked! We hastily disembarked, but with no e-bikes in sight, our only option was to catch a bus. Luckily, the bus stop was just five minutes away.

By the time we reached the bus stop, I was sweating under my hoodie.

As we waited for the bus, the boat driver kept messaging us, urging us to hurry up. I could sense the panic in his voice, which was ironic considering his WeChat name was "Never panic in any circumstances."

The bus ride felt like an eternity, even though it was only 10 minutes. Drops of sweat trickled down my forehead.

Finally, we alighted from the bus. With our feet hitting the pavement, we dashed towards the dock. "Go, go, go!" I urged, with Amber matching my pace.

But just a minute later, she received a phone call and came to an abrupt stop.

"What happened?" I asked. She explained that the boat driver had left because he couldn't delay his departure any longer.

Damn it, we were only 50 meters away from the dock!

With sore legs and an urgent need for the bathroom, we crossed the street to plan our next move.

Amber messaged the boat driver, asking if we could reserve the boat after his current ride.

I shrugged off my hoodie and stuffed it into my backpack, which weighed almost 10 kilograms with two laptops and a tablet inside.

When I zipped up my bag, Amber's phone rang. The boat driver offered to take us immediately, as his current passengers agreed to share the boat.

We assured him we'd be there shortly and set off in a sprint.

My bag bounced against my back, but the rush of adrenaline masked its weight.

Navigating through pedestrians wasn't easy, especially as Amber was on the phone with the driver, trying to locate the spot where we were to board.

Finally, the driver spotted us and led us along the lakeshore.

As we settled into the boat, we thanked the driver and his passengers profusely.

Our boat drifted through the bridge arches, swaying gently, as a cool breeze enveloped us. In that moment, every ounce of fatigue was worth it.
