### The Love for Writing

After a graduate degree in finance, Annie entered a prestigious banking firm as an intern. 

In her internship, most colleagues were friendly to her. Her workload was light, and the cafeteria was beyond her satisfaction; it even offered Tiramisu for dessert! To Annie, going to work was such a joyful thing. 

According to Einstein’s theory of relativity, time files when you are happy. After Annie’s ephemeral happy internship, things changed. 

With the rapid increase of her workload, she was busy running around between meetings, paperwork and occasional work trips. Have you ever been to a circus show, a joker was on stage, playing with five balls, throwing them up and down, trying to catch each and every one? Well, Annie was exactly like that, except for she had more balls to handle. 
Annie frequently went to a bar called “DeLumos”. She fancied this bar rather than others, partly because DeLumos was next to her building, and largely because the soft dim orange light created a warm ambiance which always calmed her down. That was exactly what she needed after a busy day. 

She sat on her favorite chair, sipping beer from a straw with her elbows on the table. The first time she visited, the bartender had to went through all drawers to get her one straw. One week later, the bartender ordered a pack of 500 straws, as Annie almost used up his inventory. She always liked straws. That’s a habit she kept, since when she was a little girl. 

Since the earliest of her memories, Annie had been the top student in her class. For academic problems, she could always find a way to tackle them. But in her work experience, she lost that sense of control and secure. Prestigious as it may be, her firm got her nerves from time to time. Her managers were great sycophants around the boss, and at the next moment they were ostentatious to their subordinates, bragging about their work. These managers had disparate views on financial markets and they made vitriolic comments to each other. They adopted dark and clandestine operations behind each other’s back to get ahead in the competition among themselves. 

Annie tried to stay focus on the professional side of her job, rather than the office politics. She searched for answers to financial problems she came across in her job, and she found a bunch of research papers, thanks to the literature searching skills she acquired in grad school. 

But Annie was not satisfied with most of them, because their findings were banal. In addition, a large part of her problems was so specific that no one had given an answer yet. 

“Maybe it’s time to create my own findings,” Annie frowned at the computer screen. 

To her surprise, writing was hard. She tried to plan each and every word in a perfect way, but always ended up stopping shortly after the beginning because it was far from perfection. 

One day, she locked herself up in her study, setting a goal of finishing an article of 1000 words. However, she put down a title and stared at the screen for the next half an hour. Eventually, she deleted the title. Rubbing her sore eyes, she glanced at her laptop screen; the blank document looked almost like a sneer taunt. Annie shut her laptop lid, stood up and left the room.

But Annie was not a quitter. She found a writing tutor named Charlie. In their first online meeting, Annie told Charlie her problems. Charlie replied, 

“The essece of writing is simple: start off with writing a bunch of garbage.”

“Put some words down, as soon as you got an even vague idea about your topic. Just write, write, and keep writing until you have the first draft. Do not let the resistance hold you back.”

“When you have the first draft, you already have at least 30% of success under your belt. The first draft is the most difficult thing to have, ever! You glared at the empty word document in despration and still not put anything down on the paper, so you know what I mean.”

“Annie, I want you to be a superb writer,” Charlie continued, “The first draft is always a great point to start.”

Before this meeting, Annie had been antsy about her writing skills, but Charlie’s soothing and mellifluous voice calmed her down. 
She replied, “Well I have been writing in a perfectionist’s way. Most words and sentences in my article should be planned before I write down the first word, and when I finish all my words, boom, there is my final version. This method never worked.”

Charlie said, “Of course it did not. You are not carving on a stone! Keep that in mind, Annie, next time when you write.”

“Modifying is the key. The good news is, modifying a draft is way easier than creating one on a blank page. Our mind is subconsciously assured when we work on a draft, because we have something to hold onto. At least this works perfect for me.”

“An article could always be better. I like this idea: an article is never finished; it is only abandoned. Good luck!”

Annie tried Charlie’s method. At first it was hard. Annie found out she was possessed by an irrational belief that she should not write anything unless it is perfect. 

Tossing that belief, Annie opened her door of creativity. One day she was totally immersed in her writing that she left the stove on and burned her water kettle. She threw the kettle away, had some cold water before returning to her study. The moment she saw the draft on her screen, a warm sense of familiarity came to her, and she realized how she loved writing. 

Later on, Charlie showed Annie how to find a “target article” and rewrite it. He explained the technique of retelling the story and how it helped his own writing skills in terms of word choosing, sentence structure and paragraph arrangement. 

Annie found some good journal papers which she tried to rewrite. Through retelling them, Annie got a firm grasp on how to express her own ideas in a clear way. Eventually she had a proclivity of reading and writing every day.

After publishing several papers, Annie accepted an invitation from a prestigious journal as a part time reviewer. On this position, she got exposed to a lot of high-quality research work. However, she noticed that her own experience and findings were different from most current work in the field of financial derivative pricing, which was her specialty. 

Annie published her own findings and soon regarded as an iconoclast, as her ideas were in the contrary to that of a bunch of renowned researchers. At first Annie’s work attracted a lot skepticism, but eventually they found out Annie was right, because she rejected a widely accepted assumption and created a new one based on a theory she found in a book, which fit the best with her hands-on experience.

This success made Annie a new star in the field. In the recent book she published, she included her work, life, and the most important of all, her love for writing.
