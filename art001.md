### The Fall of A Swindler

The number of financial scams has proliferated over the last decade, leaving investigators in a difficult position. 

One of the most important reasons is that the mindset of a swindler who is specialized in finance and liquidity management has long been regarded as unfathomable, but this is no longer the case, thanks to recent scrutiny investigations aided by advanced computer technology.

When the notorious swindler was found in one of his “safe houses”, he was munching a thick steak accompanied by shredded savory herbs. 

The moment a group of investigators burst through his door, he was struck by a strong wave of queasiness. Then he became paralyzed, only able to stare at the investigators. Meanwhile, the greasy dish coagulated on the plate quietly.
