### The Jack-Lynn Foundation

It was raining again on this Saturday afternoon. I cracked open my window just wide enough for the chilly breeze to slip in. I took some deep breaths, and my lungs filled with cold air before I shut the window. This quirky hobby of mine helped me to appreciate the coziness of my living room, where the fire cracked softly in the fireplace in front of me. 

There was nothing better than some leisure reading in this type of weather. I pulled a book from my bookshelf called *Allegories for the Wise* and turned to a story about a guy named Jack. Here it was.

From the earliest memories of Jack, there was only him and his mother. His father died in a car accident when he was very young, and his father’s face had faded over time. Following his father’s death, Jack’s mother had multiple jobs to keep food on the table. 

“My dear Jack, just remember I will always, always love you, even if I am not around. Study hard, be a brave man, like your father.” Jack’s mother often said this on their dinner table. Their kitchen was tiny, but Jack never minded that. His mother’s cooking was the best in the world.

Her arduous workload took its toll, and she passed away shortly after Jack finished high school. With his relative’s help, Jack buried his mother and left for the big city. 
As a smart and diligent young man, Jack excelled in college and became an investment banker. Within only a month on the job, he closed a successful deal. 

After the bussiness meeting, a girl came to talk to Jack. “Hey, congrats on a nice deal, my name is Megan, and this is Robert. He also takes care of investments in our company.” 

“Nice work, mate, I hope we cooperate again,” complimented Robert. Jack thanked them both and Robert left. 

Megan, however, threw Jack some questions about how he managed his portofolio. Jack could not say no to a pretty young lady like Megan, so he briefly explained. It was over 6 pm when they wrapped up, so as a way to show gratitude, Megan invited Jack to a steakhouse for dinner. 

To his surprise, Jack found he and Megan had a lot in common. They both enjoyed sitting on a bench in a busy park, observing people and guessing their stories. They both like to read long novels (with hardcovers) in a rainy day. And they both preferred John Denver over Justin Bieber.

“Well, I grew up in a small town in the Midwest,” Jack explained. “Every time I heard ‘Country roads take me home’, the roads in my town came to me. The road from school to my home was a narrow dirt road and I love it. The air was filled with the scent of dirt, trees and wild flowers were everywhere. If you hear a horse approaching, cover your nose, unless you’d like to breath in swirling dust!” 

Megan giggled. “Sounds like some place I’d like to be.”

They talked and talked until finishing up a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon.

Jack walked Megan home. They said goodnight at her doorstep, but neither moved, staring at each other with nervous smile.

An inner pulse pushed Jack forward, he leaned in and kissed Megan on the lips. Jack lost track of time, it might be three seconds, or three hours, nevertheless, their first kiss was fine. Jack had a big smile on his face on the way to his own apartment.

Jack got more and more comfortable with his job. Shortly after the first deal, he had another deal, and one after another, he was on a winning streak! He earned the title of “Rookie of the Year” in the company and was marked as the future leader. 

However, success brought hubris, and Jack began to look down on his colleagues. His arrogance drew envy and hostility, which he was unaware of, as he threw a huge amount of money on luxuries and gambled heavily.
Megan tried to talk Jack out of his bad habits, “stop gambling, Jack!” 

Jack apologized and promised to change. A few weeks later, Jack went to a bar after a bad day at work. “Accidentally”, Robert found Jack and took him back to a casino, where they spent thousands in the Texas poker game. Behind Megan’s back, Jack’s visits to casinos were filled with jaw dropping bets, continuing until his pockets were empty. 

As Jack became a regular at dinner parties of celebrities and politicians, he spent less time with Megan. He ignored her phone calls, replied her messages only few hours after he saw them. 

In the few moments when they hung out, Jack’s eyes were glued to his phone, either texting or watching Pikpok videos. Megan was crossed by Jack’s mindless giggle, Jack was impatient, “What’s the big deal? How about this honey, I will get you a Cuggi handbag. Happy now?”

After dinner Megan was reading a book and Jack started a computer game. He shouted loudly, giving his teammates orders or cursing them when he died in the game. His curse words blended with blaring electronic music. Megan urged Jack to tune it down but got neglected by him. “Do you know how shi**ty day I went through? Why won’t you let me play?”

“You know what, I’ve had enough, go live with your stupid game!!” Megan stormed out. 

Jack put away his headphones on the table and followed Megan. But he stopped before he stepped out of his door. “Maybe we are not made for each other. It’s for our best.” He mumbled. He met another girl recently at a dinner party. After all, as the old saying goes, there are plenty of fish in the sea. He broke off with Megan.

Robert came to him with an investment “offer”, which was actually a trap designed deliberately for him. If only he had consulted his colleagues, he could have avoided it. However, his over-confidence made hime mistake this offer to be a good chance. 

So, he accepted it, leading to catastrophic losses. He lost his job, sold his fancy apartments to pay his debt, and nearly went bankrupted. He looked for Robert but he had disappeared. He turned to his friends whom he met in those fancy parties for help, but they all rejected him. “Fake friends,” Jack cursed, as he had barely nothing left. In a word, the consequences of his actions were dire.

At his lowest point in his career and life, Jack turned to alcohol, only to find more sorrow and emptiness after a hangover. He almost called Megan, but he had a cold foot after dialing the number and deleted it. 

In the local pub, Jack was clearing one bottle after another, at the same time another man stumbled in. His name was Frank, an insurance selle. After a fruitless day, Frank was scolded by his boss, and he went for some booze right after work. He sat next to Jack and drank his first shot in one gulp. Quickly afterwards Frank and Jack exchanged some muddled complaints about the stupid bosses and this damp chilly weather.

Frank was not a drinker at all and his head was heavy after three shots of Toquilla, and he fell asleep. Jack left early without waking Frank up. In fact, had there been a thunder, Frank would not have woken up either. At 9:30pm Frank got out of the pub, wandering on the sidewalk because his relentlessness of going back home with nothing in his pocket.

Drinking was not enough for Jack, so he started to drive fast while being intoxicated. One night he was totally wasted, He drove so fast and recklessly.

Frank was not sure how far he walked; the neighborhood looked strange to him. At the side of his eye, he saw a car was approaching him fast.

Jack did not notice his car was racing towards the sidewalk. When he realized that he was about to hit a pedestrian, he desperately stepped on the brake. Fortunately, Jack stopped just in time. And the pedestrian, Frank, sat on the ground, panting and clutching his chest.

“Oh geeze, are you ok?” Jack rushed to the man and saw it was Frank. Jack offered to take Frank to the hospital, but Frank refused. 

“Send me home, Jack, I need to be with my family.” 

Frank knocked on his door, his wife and children went out to welcome him. Frank introduced Jack as “a friend” to them, they invited Jack inside for a cup of tea, but Jack politely turned down their offer and returned to his apartment. He lay in bed, face in his palms.

What have I done?? 

Jack thought of his own father, who died tragically in a similar accident. He could have taken the life of Frank, who was also a father. His wife became a widow, and his son would be fatherless, exactly like Jack. A cold sweat broke out across Jack’s forehead.

Realizing the ramifications of his reckless actions, Jack resolved to change. It was a hard and difficult process to drag himself back on track, but Jack made up his mind. He cut off gambling and drinking and secured an entry-level job in the investment sector. 

One day, on his way back home, he met Megan. She was glad with Jack’s change and eventually they went back together. With the help of Megan, Jack stopped his lax risk management strategy and adopted a more logical and collaborative approach to his work. Over time, Jack parlayed small investments into a large fortune. At the age of 35, Jack married Megan. 

Years later, Jack launched the “Jack-Lynn Foundation” for single mothers, in memory of his mother, Lynn. At first Megan helped organizing the events after work, but later on she switched to full-time, because she found her passion in helping others. Over the years, Jack-Lynn Foundation provided support for a large number of single moms and their families. On his 50th birthday, Jack received an accolade from the city council for his dedication to public welfare. 

In his award acceptance speech, Jack thanked his mother, his wife Megan and encapsulated his journey with a single phrase: 

“Stay humble and work hard.“

I was fully immersed within the book that I did not even notice it was dark. The rain already stopped, so I put on a coat and walked out. Breathing in the chilly yet sweet air, I was grateful for my peaceful lifestyle. 

At the same time, a question mark showed up: if I ever hit a low point in my life, could I bounce back like Jack did?
