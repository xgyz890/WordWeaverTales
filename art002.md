### The Jack-Lynn Foundation

It was raining again on this Saturday afternoon. I cracked open my window just wide enough for the chilly breeze to slip in. I took some deep breaths, and my lungs filled with cold air before I shut the window. This quirky hobby of mine helped me to appreciate the coziness of my living room, where the fire cracked softly in the fireplace in front of me. 

There was nothing better than some leisure reading in this type of weather. I pulled a book from my bookshelf called *Allegories for the Wise* and turned to a story about a guy named Jack. Here it was.

From the earliest memories of Jack, there was only him and his mother. His father died in a car accident when he was very young, and his father’s face had faded over time. Following his father’s death, Jack’s mother had multiple jobs to keep food on the table. Her arduous workload took its toll, and she passed away shortly after Jack finished high school. With his relative’s help, Jack buried his mother and left for the big city. 

As a smart and diligent young man, Jack excelled in college and became an investment banker. Within only a month on the job, he closed a successful deal. Shortly after that, he had another deal, and one after another, he was on a winning streak! He earned the title of “Rookie of the Year” in the company and was marked as the future leader. 

However, success brought hubris, and Jack began to look down on his colleagues. His arrogance drew envy and hostility, which he was unaware of, as he threw a huge amount of money on luxuries and gambled heavily. His visits to casinos were filled with jaw dropping bets, continuing until his pockets were empty. He was a regular at dinner parties of celebrities and politicians.

Then someone came to him with an investment “offer”, which was actually a trap designed deliberately for him. If only he had consulted his colleagues, he could have avoided it. However, his over-confidence made him mistake this offer to be a good chance, so he accepted it, leading to catastrophic losses. He lost his job, sold his fancy apartments to pay his debt, and nearly went bankrupted. In a word, the consequences of his actions were dire.

At his lowest point in his career and life, Jack turned to alcohol, only to find more sorrow and emptiness after a hangover. Eventually, drinking was not enough, and he started to drive fast while being intoxicated.
One night he was totally wasted, He drove so fast and recklessly that he did not notice his car was racing towards the sidewalk. When he realized that he was about to hit a pedestrian, he desperately stepped on the brake. Fortunately, Jack stopped just in time, and the pedestrian, a middle-aged father, sat on the ground, panting and clutching his chest.

Jack offered to take him to the hospital, but he requested a ride home instead. After making sure the guy’s safety, Jack returned to his apartment, lay in bed, and covered his face with his palms.

**What have I done?? **

Jack thought of his own father, who died tragically in a similar accident, and the terrifying possibility of taking another father’s life. A cold sweat broke out across Jack’s forehead.

Realizing the ramifications of his reckless actions, Jack resolved to change. It was a hard and difficult process to drag himself back on track, but Jack made up his mind. 

He cut off gambling and drinking and secured an entry-level job in the investment sector. He stopped his lax risk management strategy  and adopted a more logical and collaborative approach to his work. Over time, Jack parlayed small investments into a large fortune. 

Jack launched the “Jack-Lynn Foundation” for single mothers, in memory of his mother, Lynn. Over the years, Jack-Lynn Foundation provided support for a large number of single moms and their families. On his 50th birthday, Jack received an accolade for his dedication to public welfare. 

In his award acceptance speech, Jack encapsulated his journey with a single phrase: 

“Stay humble and work hard.”
